                 <p> Cindy is a cruiser. This is her first love. Cruising is enjoyable for many people for many reasons. It's a chance for you to disconnect
                 from work or a hectic schedule and reconnect with your playful side. In general, cruises are meant to make passengers happy, and the frequently 
                 feature nightly entertainment, a variety of onboard activities, variety in stops and all the food you could eat. However sometimes adventures 
                 have to take on another form outside of the sea and the RV is her next option of choice. </p>

               <h1> The Highlife of Crusing </h1>
                    <p> Cindy is now platium level cruising and plans on continuing the hobby. She frequents Carnival who uses a membership program called
                        VIFP. Unlike rival Royal Caribbean who does not provide a free cruise to loyalty club members who travels with them frequently. 
                        However, the VIFP Club, as Carnival's loyalty program is known, offers several useful privileges at its higher tiers, including as 
                        priority access to many onboard venues and services like that of free onboard laundry. 
                        
                        If you're wondering, VIFP stands for "very important fun person," a lighthearted reference to Carnival's moniker 
                        as the "fun ship" line.
                        
                        The VIFP Club's is really straightforward as you get one point for every day you sail on a Carnival ship.
                        So 3 points are awarded for a 3-night cruise. You'll earn 7 points if you go on a 7-night cruise.
                        As opposed to certain lines, you won't have to worry about different earning levels for different cabin grades or 
                        different sorts of bookings.
                        
                         Asking Cindy about the reasons why she cruises is a fun conversation as she lights up when talking about the various items:
