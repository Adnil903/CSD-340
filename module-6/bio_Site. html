                        Cindy is a cruiser. Cruising is enjoyable for many people. It's a chance for you to disconnect from work or a hectic 
                        schedule and reconnect with your playful side. In general, cruises are meant to make passengers happy, and they 
                        frequently feature nightly entertainment, a variety of onboard activities, variety in stops and all the food you could eat. 
                        
                        Asking Cindy about the reasons why she cruises is a fun conversation as she lights up when talking about the various items:

                        Cindy is now platium level cruising and plans on continuing the hobby. She frequents Carnival who uses a membership program called
                        VIFP. Unlike rival Royal Caribbean, Carnival does not provide a free cruise to loyalty club members who achieve the top tier. 
                        There are no 20 percent discounts on some sailings like those offered by Windstar cruises. However, the VIFP Club, as Carnival's 
                        loyalty program is known, offers several useful privileges at its higher tiers, including as priority access to many onboard 
                        venues and services. It's also a program where achieving a high-level tier is quite simple. 
                        
                        If you're wondering, VIFP stands for "very important fun person," a lighthearted reference to Carnival's moniker 
                        as the "fun ship" line.
                        
                        The VIFP Club's point-earning mechanism is really straightforward. Every day you sail on a Carnival ship earns you one point.
                        Three points are awarded for a three-night cruise. You'll earn seven points if you go on a seven-night cruise.
                        As opposed to certain lines, you won't have to worry about different earning levels for different cabin grades or 
                        different sorts of bookings.
